Note: This is a collection of experimental code not originally
intended for external usage. It has evolved during the years and could
perhaps benefit from refactoring in some places.


Prerequisites:

binutils and gcc for sh-elf and arm-elf. 

For sh-elf you are recommended to use the 20030421 (or later if deemed
appropriate) snapshot of gcc. That snapshot is know to generate correct
code for sh4 most of the time,


Building is straight forward: Just run "make"

There is currently no "install" target.

The normal place applications expect to find ronin is
/usr/local/ronin/. So unless you want to change the include and
link paths when building those applications, unpack or link ronin in
/usr/local.
